# Rogue
A Rogue-like game created during a 2Â½ weeks competence project for The National Academy of Digital Interactive Entertainment.

The game is a procedurally generated dungeon, where a player moves between 3x3 tiles (9 cells).
The game is turn-based, and versus AI. Players can move two cells per turn, but not move diagonally.
At the beginning of the game, players get a quest/task to search for a specific item (artefact) in the dungeon, and return it to the spawning area.
No-one knows what the other players need to win the game, unless they have found it. Items spawn randomly in the dungeon.

Includes an A* pathfinding algorithm, and a maze generation algorithm using Wang tiles.
